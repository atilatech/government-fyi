### Shuffle An Array Rabbit Hole (random)

- So I was trying to shuffle the array in `demographicsToIssueQuery()` and [googled "randomized array order javascript"](https://www.google.com/search?q=randomize+array+order+javascript)

- top 2 results were pretty interesting, and I learnt a bit about 
why the best random shuffle is not just random but "equally random"

### Travis CI Wierdness

- Really strange bug where some of the builds were passing in travis-ci.org but
failing in travis-ci.com
- See this PR for more info
- Turns out the issue might have been that the travis-ci.com builds didn't
have the correct environment variables so the
netlify-ci builds were "opening the browser" for authentication
 and obviously since this is happening in the ci server it was waiting indefinetely
 - Fix was to add the site id and authentication toke environment variables
