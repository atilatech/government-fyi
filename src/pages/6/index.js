					Prop 6 is predictably split along party lines. Last year, <Acronym data={Acronyms.RRAA}/> (aka as <Acronym data={Acronyms.SB}/>1) narrowly passed, with two Dems voting no and one Republican voting yes (<Citation data={Citations['1']}>thanks to some side deals</Citation>). Since its passage, Republicans have used the gas tax to <Citation data={Citations['2']}>recall a state senator</Citation> and put Prop 6 on the ballot, <Citation data={Citations['3']}>with a specific goal of increasing Republican voter turnout.</Citation>
					<br/><br/>
					Conservatives argue that the taxes are regressive, and <Citation data={Citations['5']}>CA already has the second-highest gas taxes in the country.</Citation> They also point to the state's $16B surplus (<Citation data={Citations['4']}>which about $14B is for weathering the next recession.</Citation>)
					<br/><br/>
					Democrats point to our lacking transportation infrastructure. <Citation data={Citations['6']}>CA ranks 11th in bridge quality, but 49th in road quality</Citation> They also explain that a gas tax that pays for transportation infrastructure is like a usage fee. Those who pay the most are also the biggest users.

					CA’s gas tax generates about $3.2B a year in revenue. Here’s how it's spent:
					<ul>
						<li>$400M for state bridges and culverts</li>
						<li>$200M for counties with local transportation taxes</li>
						<li>$100M to improve biking and walking projects</li>
						<li>$25M for servicing freeways</li>
						<li>$25M for sustainable community grants</li>
						<li>$7M for transportation-related research and education</li>
						<li>$5M for workforce development grants</li>
					</ul>
					With the remaining $2.5B, half goes to Caltrans for highway maintenance and repair. The other half goes to cities with local transportation infrastructure projects.
