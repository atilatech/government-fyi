					Prop 10 would repeal the <em>Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act</em>, <Citation data={Citations['1']}>a state law passed in 1995 that limits how cities can regulate rent on housing built after that year.</Citation> In addition, it explicitly said that landlords could reset rents to market rate after a tenant moved out, ending the practice of "vacancy control." <Citation data={Citations['8']}>Fifteen cities, like LA, SF, Oakland, and San Jose, already had local rent control laws in 1995, but Costa-Hawkins prevented them from regulating rents on any buildings after that.</Citation>. (Cities can implement rent control today under Costa-Hawkins, but only on buildings built before 1995. <Citation data={Citations['23']}>Three Bay Area cities did so in 2016.</Citation>)
					<br/><br/>
					By repealing <em>Costa-Hawkins</em>, Prop 10 would give cities the authority to implement local rent control on buildings built after 1995 and single-family homes, and also allow vacancy control. If and how a city implements specific policy would be up to each individual city.

					It's complicated. Prop 10 critics say rent control is problematic for CA’s housing shortage because:
					<ul>
						<li>It often isn't "means-tested". Residents who live in rent controlled apartments aren’t necessarily the people who need it the most.</li>
						<li><Citation data={Citations['4']}>It causes displacement and gentrification as some landlords try to convert their units to more profitable real estate.</Citation></li>
						<li><Citation data={Citations['5']}>It discourages real estate developers from building rental units because it affects their profit margins.</Citation></li>
					</ul>
					<Citation data={Citations['6']}>Economists generally agree that price ceilings on rental prices would lead to less available housing.</Citation> The Legislative Analyst's Office estimates that renters would move less often, property values would decrease because landlords would earn less, and <Citation data={Citations['9']}>local governments would receive less money.</Citation>

						Not so fast, fella. We all know it's expensive to rent in California. <Citation data={Citations['10']}>Renters typically pay 50% more for housing than renters in other states, and sometimes double.</Citation> Rent control helps reduce displacement for people living in increasingly expensive cities, the benefits of which are immeasurable. Prop 10 supporters argue the lack of affordable housing has led to more homelessness across the state. <Citation data={Citations['11']}>One study found that rent control in the Bay Area helped increase housing production</Citation>, contrary to what economists might predict.
						<br/><br/>
						<Citation data={Citations['7']}>Supporters also argue Prop 10 would give control back to cities.

							<br/><br/>
							<b>Does rent control increase rent on units that aren't rent-controlled?</b> <Citation data={Citations['24']}>It appears not, but SF might have been an exception.</Citation> The paper suggests that surrounding units' rental prices stay the same or are lower as a result of nearby rent controlled units.
						</span>,
						expandedContent:<span>
							<br/>
							<b>Does rent control decrease the buildings property value for landlords?</b> <Citation data={Citations['25']}>The answers are mixed. In Cambridge, MA, before rent control was removed in 1995, researchers found that property values for rent controlled buildings was lower than non-rent controlled buildings. The removal of rent control mostly equalized it.</Citation><br/><br/><Citation data={Citations['26']}>But that's just one city. Another study found that rent regulation in several New Jersey cities had no significant impact on appreciation or foreclosures.</Citation>
							<br/><br/>
							<b>Does rent control decrease housing supply or production?</b> <Citation data={Citations['28']}>The paper suggests that it does not affect production</Citation>, but <Citation data={Citations['27']}> it may decrease existing supply of units if policy is not designed well.</Citation>. <Citation data={Citations['29']}>In particular, without regulation, more landlords will likely be converting their rental units to condos.</Citation>

						description: <span>This policy brief describes how rent control would help the dire housing situation for California renters. Stagnating wages and an overheated rental market has led to a situation where government needs to step in. Rent control would reduce displacement, particularly for low-income families, people with disabilities, and people of color.<br/><br/><Citation data={Citations['17']}>Perhaps the most surprising argument is that rent control has lead to <em>increased</em> housing production, citing the Bay Area and LA.</Citation></span>,
						expandedContent:
						<span>
							<br/>
							(1) <Citation data={Citations['19']}>Rent control preserves economic diversity in neighborhoods by allowing lower paid workers (e.g. teachers, service workers, health workers) to live closer to their jobs.</Citation> <Citation data={Citations['18']}>This benefits everybody because it reduces traffic, supports local businesses, increases the cohesion of neighborhood communities,</Citation> <Citation data={Citations['22']}>and potentially decreases rental prices for <em>non-controlled</em> units.</Citation>
							<br/><br/>
							(2) <Citation data={Citations['21']}>The paper argues that rent control shouldn't be means tested (aka applying only to low-income individuals) because it would inevitably result in discrimination by landlords, who would have a monetary incentive to turn down qualifying renters.</Citation>
							<br/><br/>
							(3) <Citation data={Citations['20']}>The paper cautions that rent control is not the solution to CA's housing problem. It is the first step. They also say that thoughtful policy design is required to minimize the downsides of rent control.</Citation>
