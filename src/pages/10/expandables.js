Landlords’ substitution toward owner occupied and high-end new construction rental housing fueled the gentrification of San Francisco, as these types of properties cater to higher income individuals.",

    directQuote:"Overall, the measure likely would reduce state and local revenues in the long term, with the largest effect on property taxes. The amount of revenue loss would depend on many factors, most importantly how communities respond to this measure. If several communities expand moderate rent control to cover most of their rental housing, revenue losses could be in the tens of millions of dollars per year. If few communities make changes, revenue losses would be minor. If many communities pass strong rent control, revenue losses could be in the hundreds of millions of dollars per year."

Rent is high in California because the state does not have enough housing for everyone who wants to live here. People who want to live here must compete for housing, which increases rents."

    directQuote:"In 1979, San Francisco imposed rent control on all standing buildings with 5 or more apartments. New construction was exempt from rent control, since legislators did not want to discourage new development. In addition, smaller multi-family buildings were exempt from this 1979 law change since they were viewed as more “mom and pop” ventures, and did not have market power over rents. However, this exemption was lifted through a 1994 San Francisco ballot initiative. "

Only 18% of the control group still remained at their 1994 address for this long. This implies that the 3.5 percentage point increase represents a 19.4 percent increase in not moving (3.5/18), relative to the control group’s migration rate.",

They then could either reset rents to market rates with a new tenant or redevelop the building as condos or new construction, both of which are exempt from rent control. We find evidence for both of these effects.",

Finally, landlords are legally allowed to offer their tenants monetary compensation for leaving."

    directQuote:"Others raise concern that rent control may decrease housing  and property values, and subsequently impact tax revenues. Yet, numerous empirical studies, as well as housing production trends in cities with rent control, show no negative effect on housing production, often finding that other local conditions and market cycles have a greater influence on supply. The three largest Bay Area cities with rent control (San Francisco, San Jose, and Oakland) have only 27 percent of the region’s housing but ... those cities have built 43 percent of the Bay Area’s new multifamily rental units in buildings... Similarly, the City of Los Angeles, with 42 percent of the housing in Los Angeles County, has built 62 percent of new multifamily rentals since 2000."

The researchers suggested that wealthier households moved into the city after lower-income tenants had been displaced by unregulated rent increases, while they may not have been willing to move in prior to decontrol."

    directQuote:"We acknowledge that in addition to rent control being just one part of the solution, it also has limitations and requires thoughtful policy design to mitigate any downsides. We believe that none of these limitations should preclude the use of rent control to prevent residential displacement, but it is important to consider and respond to these limitations when designing local programs."

    directQuote:"A common critique of rent control is that it is not means-tested, and thus does not specifically target the renters that need it most. Proponents of rent control point out an important reality: that any means-testing would very likely lead to discrimination against low-income renters because landlords would be incentivized to evict eligible tenants or solely rent to non-qualifying tenants who could pay higher rents.
