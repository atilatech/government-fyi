    directQuote:"Overall, the measure likely would reduce state and local revenues in the long term, with the largest effect on property taxes. The amount of revenue loss would depend on many factors, most importantly how communities respond to this measure. If several communities expand moderate rent control to cover most of their rental housing, revenue losses could be in the tens of millions of dollars per year. If few communities make changes, revenue losses would be minor. If many communities pass strong rent control, revenue losses could be in the hundreds of millions of dollars per year."

New construction was exempt from rent control, since legislators did not want to discourage new development. In addition, smaller multi-family buildings were exempt from this 1979 law change since they were viewed as more “mom and pop” ventures, and did not have market power over rents. However, this exemption was lifted through a 1994 San Francisco ballot initiative. "

Only 18% of the control group still remained at their 1994 address for this long. This implies that the 3.5 percentage point increase represents a 19.4 percent increase in not moving (3.5/18), relative to the control group’s migration rate.",

Yet, numerous empirical studies, as well as housing production trends in cities with rent control, show no negative effect on housing production, often finding that other local conditions and market cycles have a greater influence on supply. The three largest Bay Area cities with rent control (San Francisco, San Jose, and Oakland) have only 27 percent of the region’s housing but ... those cities have built 43 percent of the Bay Area’s new multifamily rental units in buildings... Similarly, the City of Los Angeles, with 42 percent of the housing in Los Angeles County, has built 62 percent of new multifamily rentals since 2000."
