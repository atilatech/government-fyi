    directQuote:"However, landlords of properties affected by the law change respond over the long term by substituting to other types of real estate, in particular by converting to condos and redeveloping buildings so as to exempt them from rent control. Landlordsâ€™ substitution toward owner occupied and high-end new construction rental housing fueled the gentrification of San Francisco, as these types of properties cater to higher income individuals.",

    directQuote:"But more than a dozen cities across the state, from Santa Monica and Los Angeles to San Francisco and Berkeley, had already in the late 1970s and early 1980s adopted local rent control ordinances. The 1995 law essentially froze those in place, preventing them from being changed."

    directQuote:"Overall, the measure likely would reduce state and local revenues in the long term, with the largest effect on property taxes. The amount of revenue loss would depend on many factors, most importantly how communities respond to this measure. If several communities expand moderate rent control to cover most of their rental housing, revenue losses could be in the tens of millions of dollars per year. If few communities make changes, revenue losses would be minor. If many communities pass strong rent control, revenue losses could be in the hundreds of millions of dollars per year."

    directQuote:"Renters in California typically pay 50 percent more for housing than renters in other states. In some parts of the state, rent costs are more than double the national average. Rent is high in California because the state does not have enough housing for everyone who wants to live here. People who want to live here must compete for housing, which increases rents."
