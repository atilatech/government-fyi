					No kidding. Prop 8 is the result of ongoing disputes between a labor organization, <Acronym data={Acronyms.SEIU}/> West, and CA’s two largest dialysis businesses, <em>DaVita</em> and <em>Fresenius Medical Care</em>. <Acronym data={Acronyms.SEIU}/> <Citation data={Citations['7']}>West has been trying to unionize dialysis healthcare workers since 2016, but have so far been unsuccessful.</Citation> <Citation data={Citations['8']}>They’ve used the ballot initiative process to leverage negotiations in the past</Citation>, and Prop 8 is their latest effort.
					<br/><br/>
					<Citation data={Citations['5']}><Acronym data={Acronyms.SEIU}/> West say they want to improve the quality of patient care in these highly-profitable clinics, while opponents claim they’re simply trying to recruit more union members.</Citation> <Citation data={Citations['3']}>The aforementioned dialysis companies have raised $66M to fight the initiative and the labor union has spent more than $20M campaigning for Prop 8.</Citation>

					It’s unclear. Prop 8’s revenue cap could cause clinics to increase spending on “direct patient care services” and “healthcare improvements,” but <Citation data={Citations['6']}>critics argue that these categories don’t include spending on medical directors, clinic coordinators, regulatory compliance, or other costs.</Citation> 115% of a smaller cost total = less profit = some clinics could shutdown, endangering patients’ lives.
					<br/><br/>
					<Citation data={Citations['4']}>The Legislative Analyst's Office, however, reports that the financial impact on dialysis clinics is generally unknown because they can't predict what clinics will do.</Citation>
