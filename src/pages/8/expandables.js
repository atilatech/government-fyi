    directQuote:"Different interpretations of the measure’s provisions and different CDC [chronic dialysis clincs] responses to the measure would lead to different impacts for state and local governments. In light of significant uncertainty about how the measure may be interpreted and how CDCs may respond, a range of possible net impacts on state and local government finances is possible.",

    directQuote:" It would attempt to reduce a dialysis provider’s profit margin by limiting its revenue to 115 percent of its spending on “direct patient care and healthcare improvements.” However, the definition of such is a matter of dispute. Opponents note that it would not include legitimate expenses such as clinic coordinators, professional services, regulatory compliance and security.",

    headline:"A measure that does not belong on the state ballot — ",
    directQuote:"If workers are so universally disgruntled, why haven’t they voted to unionize? Steve Trossman, a spokesman for the union, said it has proved impossible because of the intimidation of pro-union workers — and the employers have chosen to defy weakly enforced labor laws. “It’s trying to achieve the same goal in a different way,” Trossman said."

    directQuote:"The proposals closely resemble pending bills that have thrust for-profit dialysis centers, which treat more than 63,000 Californians with end-stage kidney disease, into the legislative fray. By dangling the prospect of a ballot measure as a backup plan, the union is following a well-worn path to spur legislative action.\"We see it as a two-pronged approach,\" said Sean Wherley, spokesman for SEIU-UHW. \"We want to be sure we have as many options available as possible.\""
