    directQuote:"A tip-off on the true nature of Prop. 3 can be found in the $100,000 donation to the cause from Stewart Resnick, the billionaire Central Valley almond grower who is a backer of the $19 billion Delta twin tunnels project. The proposition would provide $750 million to the Friant Water Authority for repairs of canals damaged from Big Ag drawing too much groundwater from aquifers, rather than the norm of holding the water agency and its ratepayers responsible for the damage.",

    headline:"Editorial | Proposition 3: Two biggest reasons to oppose water bond in November election",
    directQuote:"The first and most obvious is that Proposition 3 is on the ballot not because the Legislature thought it was necessary but because of signature-gatherers paid by those who stand to benefit from the bond. A July 16 CALmatters story noted that more than half the money raised to promote the measure came from business groups and farmers seeking specific improvements, especially to the 152-mile-long Friant-Kern Canal in the Central Valley.

The amount of funding would be equal to each agency’s additional electricity costs associated with state programs to reduce GHGs."
