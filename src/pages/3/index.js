					Oh definitely, and especially farmers and agricultural water suppliers. Prop 3 would specifically improve the conditions of watershed lands ($2.5B), drinking water ($2.1B), fish and wildlife habitats ($1.4B), canals and water facilities ($1.2B), groundwater ($1.1B), and flood protection ($500M). The Legislative Analyst‚Äôs Office estimates that repaying Prop 3 would cost about $430M a year for the next 40 years, totaling $17.3B with interest, which is about 1/3 of one percent of CA‚Äôs General Fund budget.

					Critics of Prop 3 agree. Unlike Prop 68, which was put on the ballot by the state legislature,<Citation data={Citations['3']}> Prop 3 is on the ballot because the authors gathered enough signatures.</Citation> <Citation data={Citations['5']}>Opponents say it's a ‚Äúpay-to-play‚Äù ballot measure that not only lacks administrative oversight, but also funds projects that directly benefit those who backed the campaign.</Citation> Prop 3 has raised about $3.4M from notable donors, including Land O' Lakes and Wonderful Orchards (the producers of POM juice and FIJI water). <Citation data={Citations['2']}>The owners of Wonderful Orchards, for instance, have farmland that sits in Kern County, of which $750M of Prop 3 would go towards fixing a damaged canal that waters the region.</Citation>
					<br/><br/>
					On the other hand, <Citation data={Citations['4']}>supporters argue that Prop 3 is a bipartisan initiative that doesn‚Äôt just focus on urban, coastal water problems like Prop 68, but commits significant funding and resources to inland California.</Citation> Local water authorities along with agriculture and conservation groups also support Prop 3 saying it‚Äôs a critical step to upgrading CA‚Äôs water system.
