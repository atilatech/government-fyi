					<br/><br/>
					Prop 4 would issue $1.5B in general obligation bonds to renovate and upgrade CA’s children's hospitals, specifically eight private, nonprofit hospitals ($135M each), five <Acronym data={Acronyms.UC}/> medical centers ($54M each), and other hospitals that treat children in specialized wings ($150M). The bond measure would be repaid from CA's General Fund.
					<br/><br/>
					General obligation bonds are loans from investors that are repaid by the state over time with interest. <Citation data={Citations['2']}>The $1.5B would cost us $2.9B over 35 years, or $80M annually (roughly 0.1% of our annual budget).</Citation>
