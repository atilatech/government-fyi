This would result in average repayment costs of about $80 million annually over the next 35 years. This amount is less than one-tenth of 1 percent of the state’s current General Fund budget.",

    directQuote:"David Wolfe, a legislative director with the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association, expressed concerns about the initiative, saying private donations or the state general fund, rather than bonds with added interest, could be used to pay for hospital renovations, according to the report.
