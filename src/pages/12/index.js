					If you eat eggs or care about how your meat is farmed, then this is prop is for you.

					Prop 12 would set minimum space requirements for egg-laying hens, pigs, and baby cows, and ban the sales of meat and eggs from animals that aren't in compliance, even if they're raised outside of California. <Citation data={Citations['12']}>Prop 12 would also require all egg-laying hens be literally cage-free by 2022.</Citation>

				<span>
					The origins of Prop 12 actually began a decade ago with Prop 2. <Citation data={Citations['1']}>In 2008, we passed Prop 2 which said animals sold for meat and eggs must be able <em>&ldquo;to lie down, stand up, fully extend their limbs and turn around.&rdquo;</em></Citation> The policy was later expanded to include all eggs sold in CA, regardless of where they were laid.
					<br/><br/>
					Farmers were pissed. Some of the reasons they've been fighting Prop 2 are relevant to Prop 12 today. They claimed Prop 2 was:
					<ul>
						<li><b>unconstitutional</b> â€“Â It required out-of-state farmers selling eggs in CA to comply with its policies. Just last year, 13 states filed a lawsuit to repeal Prop 2 with the US Supreme Court. <Citation data={Citations['2']}> Last year, 13 states filed a suit with the US Supreme Court to repeal it.</Citation></li>
						<li><b>too vague</b> â€“ and therefore unenforceable. <Citation data={Citations['6']}>A salty judge disagreed</Citation>, and California did eventually land on a number for hens: <Citation data={Citations['5']}>116 square inches.</Citation></li>
						<li><b>expensive</b> â€“ <Citation data={Citations['7']}>It cost CA farmers several hundred million to convert their hen housing systems</Citation>, but <Citation data={Citations['8']}>it seems they would have done that anyway because of salmonella outbreaks</Citation> and <Citation data={Citations['9']}>shifting public opinion.</Citation></li>
						<li><b>hurtful to production</b> â€“ <Citation data={Citations['14']}>By 2016, academics estimated say egg production dropped by 35%</Citation>, and <Citation data={Citations['10']}>prices rose by 33%.</Citation></li>
						<li><b>ineffective</b> - Because the law didn't specify an enforcing authority, it fell on localities to enforce the law, and surprise (<span role="img" aria-label="surprise">ðŸŽ‰</span>), it didnâ€™t happen. <Citation data={Citations['13']}>The LA Times says two-thirds of hens are still in cages, </Citation> <Citation data={Citations['16']}>perhaps just less cramped than before.</Citation></li>
					</ul>
					Despite these grievances, advocates say Prop 2 followed the tide of public opinion, and it resulted in cleaner and more humanely-raised food. Supporters also say it spurred <Citation data={Citations['3']}>many corporations like McDonaldâ€™s, Costco, and Walmart to pledge to sell cage-free eggs for the next 5-10 years.</Citation>
					<br/><br/>
					Well, Prop 12 pushes what Prop 2 started further.

				title: "So what does Prop 12 do differently?",
				text:
				<span>
					For starters, Prop 12 sets specific space requirements and actually <Citation data={Citations['17']}>deems the CA Department of Food and Agriculture responsible for enforcing the law. This additional oversight is estimated to cost the state $10M annually.</Citation>
					<br/><br/>
					<Citation data={Citations['18']}>Prop 12 also outlines that egg-laying hens must be legitimately cage-free by 2022. This means farmers have to allocate 1 to 1.5 sq. feet per hen, and allow hens to freely move around inside a building.</Citation>

					<Citation data={Citations['19']}> Prop 12 opponents criticize Prop 12 for all the same reasons (except "too vague") they criticized Prop 2.
