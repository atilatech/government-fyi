					If Prop 7 passes, it gives the California state legislature the power to change Daylight Saving Time, with two-thirds vote, as long as it's cool with federal law. <Citation data={Citations['2']}>Currently, federal law only allows states to follow <Acronym data={Acronyms.DST}/> exactly (you know â€“ "March forward, November back," or something), or opt-out (like <Acronym data={Acronyms.AZ}/> and <Acronym data={Acronyms.HI}/>) </Citation>. If we wanted to move to <Acronym data={Acronyms.DST}/> year-round, which is what's being argued for, <Citation data={Citations['1']}>California needs Congress to amend the Uniform Time Act of 1966</Citation>.
					<br/><br/>
					<em>Again, passing Prop 7 does not immediately change anything regarding <Acronym data={Acronyms.DST}/></em>. It gives them the power to do so, voices our public opinion to our  legislators, and points us down the path of year-round DST.
					<br/><br/>
					With that in mind...

					On the flip side, <Citation data={Citations['6']}>proponents argue that later sunsets result in electricity savings from reduced lighting</Citation>, but <Citation data={Citations['7']}>this may be negated by increased <Acronym data={Acronyms.AC}/> usage</Citation>.
