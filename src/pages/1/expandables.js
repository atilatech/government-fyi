    directQuote:"The cost of these bonds would depend on various factors—such as the interest rates in effect at the time they are sold, the timing of the bond sales, and the time period over which they are repaid. We estimate that the cost to taxpayers to repay the bonds would average about $170 million annually for 35 years—totaling $5.9 billion to pay off both the principal ($3 billion) and interest ($2.9 billion). This amount is about one-tenth of 1 percent of the state’s current General Fund budget",
