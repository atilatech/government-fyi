					Yep, at least on what the proposition intends to do. How you should vote, however, not so much. Essentially, Prop 1 would issue $4B in general obligation bonds to fund housing programs.
					<br/><br/>
					General obligation bonds are loans from investors that are repaid by the state over time with interest. $1B would be housing loans for veterans, which are of no cost to the state, and <Citation data={Citations['1']}>the rest of the money ($3B) would cost the state $5.9B, or $170M annually, to repay. It adds up to roughly 0.1% of our annual budget.</Citation></span>,

					Nope! Prop 1 is a part of a package of bills that intends to increase housing production and lower housing costs for residents. By law, every resident has to approve, aka vote, on bonds that cost more than $300K.
					<br/><br/>
					<Citation data={Citations['3']}>Opponents argue that with high taxes and a state budget surplus of $16B, legislators should make structural reforms rather than create more debt. Prop 1 is another band-aid, they claim, not a solution.</Citation> <Citation data={Citations['4']}>Critics point to <Acronym data={Acronyms.CEQA}/>, rent control, and  labor wages as examples of regulation that have driven up construction costs and contributed to CAâ€™s housing shortage.</Citation>
					<br/><br/>
					Almost everyone agrees that housing affordability in CA is a critical issue, but how we resolve it remains contentious.
