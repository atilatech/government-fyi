    directQuote:"\"I recognize that this housing is needed, but stealing treatment money from the severely mentally ill is despicable and counterproductive,\" Bernard said. Some mental health advocates share Bernard's concern about the money being spent on a housing bond when needs for services remain high.\"It was a treatment-first law, not a housing-first law,\" said Rose King, who co-authored the 2004 initiative.",

    headline:"Opinion: Proposition 2: First invest in our people",
    directQuote:"Proposition 2 is unnecessary because in 2017, the Legislature, through Assembly Bill 727, allowed counties to accumulate MHSA capital funds up to 10 years, enabling them to “pay as you go” both to build housing and help pay rent subsidies for these clients. This proposition goes against the intent of the MHSA approved by the voters in 2004 to allow counties maximum “home rule” flexibility to best determine how to spend their MHSA allocated funds, whether for treatment and/or housing."
