					<span>
						<Citation data={Citations['1']}>The Millionaire‚Äôs tax was originally passed as Prop 63 in 2004, and it was intended to help counties create and expand mental health services with a "treatment-first" approach.</Citation> <Citation data={Citations['2']}>In 2016, however, the state legislature took a ‚Äúhousing-first‚Äù approach and passed a program called <em>No Place Like Home</em> to build permanent supportive housing for homeless people with mental illnesses. The one-time $2B program would have re-purposed funds from Prop 63</Citation>, <Citation data={Citations['3']}> but a lawsuit claimed Prop 63 didn‚Äôt specify housing costs, and the legislature can't change a Prop 63, a voter approved measure.</Citation>
						<br/><br/>
						Now it's being thrown back to voters. If Prop 2 passes, the <em>No Place Like Home</em> program would receive $120M a year from the $2B generated annually by the Millionaire's tax.
						<br/><br/>
						If Prop 2 fails, we leave it up to the courts to decide whether <em>No Place Like Home</em> can use Prop 63's money.
