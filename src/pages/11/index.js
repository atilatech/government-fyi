					Okay, here’s the predictably political backstory:
					<br/><br/>
					<Citation data={Citations['1']}>In 2016, the CA Supreme Court ruled that <em>security workers</em> were no longer required to keep their radios on during their scheduled breaks.</Citation> Suddenly, on-call breaks became illegal (but not explicitly for ambulances) and it <Citation data={Citations['10']}>prompted EMTs to file similar lawsuits against ambulance companies.</Citation> <Citation data={Citations['12']}>These suits are still ongoing.</Citation>
					<br/><br/>
					The following year, <Citation data={Citations['13']}>labor unions and private ambulance companies tried to work it out in the state legislature</Citation> <Citation data={Citations['9']}>, but the two sides couldn't reach an agreement.</Citation> <Citation data={Citations['6']}>In an attempt to stave off more lawsuits and labor union policies, American Medical Response, the country’s largest ambulance company, spent $7.8M to put Prop 11 on the ballot.</Citation>
					<br/><br/>
					Prop 11 would also absolve private ambulance companies from any liability they might have incurred since that CA Supreme Court ruling, such as not paying workers during their previously interrupted breaks.
				</span>
			}
		},
		{
			component: TextWithTitleBlock,
			data: {
				title:"Why not just give EMTs real breaks?",
				text:
				<span>
					It’d be too expensive. <Citation data={Citations['11']}>The US Department of Health mandates that ambulance service reach 75% of life-threatening calls within eight minutes.</Citation> To match their current coverage and response times, ambulance companies would have to hire significantly more EMTs. <Citation data={Citations['2']}>The Legislative Analyst’s Office estimates that these increased costs – about $100M – would likely fall to local governments.</Citation>
				</span>
			}
		},
		{

			data: {
				title: "What do EMTs think?",
				text:
				<span>
					The EMT labor union spoke out against Prop 11, but other than that, <Citation data={Citations['7']}>it’s been kind of quiet.</Citation> No one even submitted an official ballot argument against Prop 11.
