					Okay, hereâ€™s the predictably political backstory:
					<br/><br/>
					<Citation data={Citations['1']}>In 2016, the CA Supreme Court ruled that <em>security workers</em> were no longer required to keep their radios on during their scheduled breaks.</Citation> Suddenly, on-call breaks became illegal (but not explicitly for ambulances) and it <Citation data={Citations['10']}>prompted EMTs to file similar lawsuits against ambulance companies.</Citation> <Citation data={Citations['']}>These suits are still ongoing.</Citation>
					<br/><br/>
					The following year, <Citation>labor unions started promoting legislation requiring employers to provide uninterruptible breaks or pay employees for their breaks that are interrupted.</Citation> <Citation data={Citations['9']}>The legislation didnâ€™t pan out</Citation>, and ambulance companies started to freak out. <Citation data={Citations['6']}>In an attempt to stave off more lawsuits and labor union policies, American Medical Response, the countryâ€™s largest ambulance company, spent $7.8M to put Prop 11 on the ballot.</Citation>
					<br/><br/>
					Prop 11 happens to also absolve private ambulance companies from any liability they might have incurred since that CA Supreme Court ruling, such as not paying workers during their previously interrupted breaks.
					<br/><br/>
					If Prop 11 fails, and courts rule that paramedicsâ€™ breaks cannot be interrupted, then the ambulance companies will have to hire about 25% more workers to match their current coverage and response times. <Citation data={Citations['2']}>The burden of these increased costs â€“ about $100M â€“ would likely fall on local governments</Citation>

				title:"Why not just give EMTs real breaks?",
				text:

					Itâ€™d be too expensive. <Citation>The US Department of Health mandates that ambulance service reach 75% of life-threatening calls within eight minutes.</Citation> <Citation>Ambulance companies would have to hire about 25% more EMTs to match their current coverage and response times.</Citation> <Citation data={Citations['11']}>The Legislative Analystâ€™s Office estimates that these increased costs â€“ about $100M â€“ would likely fall to local governments.</Citation>
