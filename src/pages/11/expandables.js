		directQuote:"And so the industry — seeking not only to close off its exposure to lawsuits, but also to avoid future efforts by organized labor to enshrine the work rules in state law — decided to take its chances with voters. American Medical Response, one of the country’s largest ambulance companies, spent $2.8 million to gather the voter signatures needed to qualify for what became Proposition 11."

Perhaps the most surprising moment came when no one — not even a member of the public — submitted any written argument against the measure to be included in the statewide voter information guide.",

One goal of the bill is to clarify that the California Supreme Court's ruling in Augustus v. ABM Security Services applies to EMS workers, according to a document issued by Rodriguez's office. That ruling held that California workers need to have uninterrupted rest breaks, and the bill would codify the court's decision."
