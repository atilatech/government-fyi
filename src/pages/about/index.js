The first ballot.fyi, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://original.ballot.fyi/">2016 edition</a>, reached a million people in one month. Soon afterwards, we received a $75K grant to write ballot.fyi for 2018. The grant came from <a href="https://knightfoundation.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The John S. and James L. Knight Foundation</a> – a nonpartisan org that promotes informed communities through funding in journalism, technology, and the arts.
				<br/><br/>
				In addition to ballot.fyi, Jimmy Chion and Yvonne Leow started <em>By The Bay</em> in early 2018, a local media site for the Bay Area, covering local issues and elections. By The Bay was shut down in early 2019, but ballot.fyi – which will only cover state-wide ballot initiatives – will continue as a volunteer-led project for as long as California propositions need explaining.
