We first made ballot.fyi in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://original.ballot.fyi/">2016</a>. It reached a million people in one month, and in 2017, we received a generous grant from The John S. and James L. Knight Foundation to continue ballot.fyi into 2018. <a href="https://knightfoundation.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Knight Foundation</a> promotes informed and engaged communities through funding in journalism, arts, and technology.

					We believe local politics is more important than national politics, so we created <a href="https://www.bythebay.cool/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">By The Bay</a> to cover issues in San Francisco, building on what we learned with ballot.fyi in 2016. If you live in San Francisco or San Jose, go to <a href="https://www.bythebay.cool/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bythebay.cool</a> to check out our coverage of SF and SJ's local elections. </span>,
