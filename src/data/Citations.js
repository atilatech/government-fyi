            Prevents refugees who made claims in the US from making claims in Canada.
            For example, if you are a Syrian refugee and you applied for refugee status in Canada.
            If you land in America first, America can decide if they should give you asylum.
            If they say no, you can’t try and apply for asylum in Canada.
            The original intention was that Canada and the US both have similar values for determining if someone should be given refugee status.
            So if the US said no, Canada would likely say no as well.
