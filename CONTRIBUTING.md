### Best Practices for Including Sources

1. Try to get the source directly from the campaign's website, if not, use authoritative sources of news.
    1. The definition of "authoritative" is subjective, so just try and use your best judgement

1. Try to reference websites instead of PDFs. Some people may be on their phone and not have wi-fi and PDFs automatically download the file.
    1. However, this is hard to do as many parties publish their policies as PDFs so if the best source you can find is a PDF, that's okay.

1. When linking a PDF, ensure you include the specific page that a policy is taken from in the URL
    1. Add `#page=page_number` to the end of the url
    1. Example: https://juventudedesporto.cplp.org/files/sample-pdf_9359.pdf#page=5

1. Sources should be recent: Don't reference anything published more than 12 months before the currrent date.
